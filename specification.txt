REQUIREMENTS:
*When i open the app i want it to display 00:00.
*When i press Begin it counts and shows me that i am working.
*(Break is displayed).

*When i press Break, it start counting down for the duration of the break,
*which lasts 5 times shorter than the time spent working.

*When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm.

***Cancel at any time. (goes into idle)
***Pause at any time (except when idle)


TODO:
- add a reset button
- while break ticks down you could have a charging battery filling up (maybe in thirds,
battery with 3 bars
- remove the window bar and add rounded borders (same color as text maybe)

LOGS:
But if you exit the app, that needs to be captured (logged).

- Within a day
- Making images that are shown by date (Date + Day of the week)
- hours studying per day
- hours studying per week





PERHAPS time and period, instead of being an integer, should be refactored to value objects?

- Potential errors if you work for less than a second, or less than 5.

FEATURE: Logging breaks and works. Also, logging how much time you 
ACTUALLY spent on a break, while the timer was 0.










BUGFIX: When pausing while on break the timer correctly stops counting. But it
incorrectly says Break over! when and displays 00:00.
FIXED: It was because the counter is a little weirdo. Scheduled tasks can't be
stopped, i had to add logic that prevents that. I don't understand the library fully...
BUG: If you pause and resume before the original break interval, you get alarmed twice.
FIXED: shutdowNow() does a full shutdown, so that works.
