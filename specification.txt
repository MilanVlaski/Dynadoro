REQUIREMENTS:
When i open the app i want it to display 00:00.
When i press Begin it counts and shows me that i am working.
(Break is displayed).

When i press Break, it start counting down for the duration of the break,
which lasts 5 times shorter than the time spent working.

TODO: Thread updating the time of display, right?

When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm.

***Verify that the state of display is changing (time), and then
you dont have to verify whether that works for every single case.

NOTES:
I have decided not to test whether the display shows the right commands,
and whether it captures state correctly, therefore saving myself millions of 
braincells.

CONSIDER that the display may have increment(), decrement(), reset methods,
instead of only setTime().

Updating the display has a bunch of temporal coupling associated with it.
But i dont like the alternatives.

TODO:
***Make the string that represents state an enum.
***Refactor tests (take out constants and stuff)
