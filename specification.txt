When i open the app i want it to display 00:00.
When i press Begin it counts and shows me that i am working.
(Break is displayed).

When i press Break, it should reset the timer.

Then it starts counting down for the duration of the break,
which lasts 5 times shorter than the time spent working.

When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm until i stop it,
which restarts the whole process.
