REQUIREMENTS:
When i open the app i want it to display 00:00.
When i press Begin it counts and shows me that i am working.
(Break is displayed).

When i press Break, it start counting down for the duration of the break,
which lasts 5 times shorter than the time spent working.

When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm.

Cancel at any time. (goes into idle)
Pause at any time (except when idle)




NOTES:
1. Make a CounterInterface, that must depend on timer.
2. Inject it into timer.

PERHAPS time and period, instead of being an integer, should be refactored to oop?

- Potential errors if you work for less than a second, or less than 5.

When the break timer runs out, we are still in break state.

FEATURE: Logging breaks and works. Also, logging how much time you 
ACTUALLY spent on a break, while the timer was 0.

TODO:
- Add tests to TestTimer that trigger exceptions.
- Pausing while idle throws an exception
- Pausing then restarting on break
- Pausing then restarting while working
