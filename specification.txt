REQUIREMENTS:
When i open the app i want it to display 00:00.
When i press Begin it counts and shows me that i am working.
(Break is displayed).

When i press Break, it start counting down for the duration of the break,
which lasts 5 times shorter than the time spent working.

TODO: Thread updating the time of display, right?

When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm.

***Verify that the state of display is changing (time), and then
you dont have to verify whether that works for every single case.

NOTES:
I have decided not to test whether the display shows the right commands,
and whether it captures state correctly, therefore saving myself millions of 
braincells.

CONSIDER that the display may have increment(), decrement(), reset methods,
instead of only setTime().

Updating the display has a bunch of temporal coupling associated with it.
But i dont like the alternatives.


COUNTER:
You can start it and it counts up (maybe set arbitrary limit).
You can make it start at a certain number > 0, then count down to 0.
It can be stopped manually, or once it hits 0.
If i run a counter for one second, then it updates the display once with param 1.
If i run it for 10 seconds, it updates in ten times, with params 1,...,10
HOW TO simulate running it for a certain amount of time?
CONSIDER just testing that it works for one and two seconds, pausing the test.
(Pause and resume)

Maybe display should have different update methods for updating timer or state.
(or both?) (for console display you have to refresh everything,
but for a real display, two methods makes lots of sense)
