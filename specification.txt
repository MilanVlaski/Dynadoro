REQUIREMENTS:
When i open the app i want it to display 00:00.
When i press Begin it counts and shows me that i am working.
(Break is displayed).

When i press Break, it start counting down for the duration of the break,
which lasts 5 times shorter than the time spent working.

Cancel feature (goes into idle)

TODO: Thread updating the time of display, right?

When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm.

NOTES:
Updating the display has a bunch of temporal coupling associated with it.
But i dont like the alternatives yet.
Maybe display should have different update methods for updating timer or state.
(or both?) (for console display you have to refresh everything,
but for a real display, two methods makes lots of sense)

COUNTER:
You can start it and it counts up (maybe set arbitrary limit).
You can make it start at a certain number > 0, then count down to 0.
It can be stopped manually, or once it hits 0.
HOW TO simulate running it for a certain amount of time?
CONSIDER just testing that it works for one and two seconds, pausing the test.
(an integration test! - because you dont mind waiting 2 seconds in that case)
