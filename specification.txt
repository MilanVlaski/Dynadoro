REQUIREMENTS:
*When i open the app i want it to display 00:00.
*When i press Begin it counts and shows me that i am working.
*(Break is displayed).

*When i press Break, it start counting down for the duration of the break,
*which lasts 5 times shorter than the time spent working.

*When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm.

***Cancel at any time. (goes into idle)
***Pause at any time (except when idle)




PERHAPS time and period, instead of being an integer, should be refactored to value objects?

- Potential errors if you work for less than a second, or less than 5.

When the break timer runs out, we are still in break state.

FEATURE: Logging breaks and works. Also, logging how much time you 
ACTUALLY spent on a break, while the timer was 0.

TODO:
***- Pausing while idle throws an exception
***- Pausing then restarting on break
***- Pausing then restarting while working
***- Working, then pausing, then taking break - actually an easy feature
REJECTED- Break, then pausing, then working (BAD because its annoying to do, and not a useful feature)
***- Counter could perhaps have no need for pausing, but it just gets restarted using
  data from states (already done?)
***- Counter stops when you pause
***- Test display behavior (mocks)

BUGFIX: When pausing while on break the timer correctly stops counting. But it
incorrectly says Break over! when and displays 00:00.
FIXED: It was because the counter is a little weirdo. Scheduled tasks can't be
stopped, i had to add logic that prevents that. I don't understand the library fully...
