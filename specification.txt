REQUIREMENTS:
*When i open the app i want it to display 00:00.
*When i press Begin it counts and shows me that i am working.
*(Break is displayed).

*When i press Break, it start counting down for the duration of the break,
*which lasts 5 times shorter than the time spent working.

*When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm.

***Cancel at any time. (goes into idle)
***Pause at any time (except when idle)

TODO:
- while break ticks down you could have a charging battery filling up (maybe in thirds,
battery with 3 bars
- remove the window bar and add rounded borders (same color as text maybe)

LOGS:
- If you exit the app, the previous state needs to finish.
- We have our UsageFile and our VisualDay. When we select the option to show these images,
it shows all of them, with (November, 23, Tuesday... + Thumbnail or full image). We keep
the images and file consistent by loading the file data to memory (creating objects out of
collections of StateInfos and mapping them to images). If extra images exist, we delete them.
And if an object (a Day), doesn't have an image (Tuesday_23_November.png - DayVisual),
it gets created. A Day has States, and a Day must have a VisualDay. States have start
and end time. (Based on this you can make an arc. Combining the arcs gives you whole picture).
(we don't care about a day that doesn't have states, it doesn't get logged).

- Creating images for date (displays Date + Day of the week)
- hours studying per day
- hours studying per week
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PERHAPS time and period, instead of being an integer, should be refactored to value objects?

- Potential errors if you work for less than a second, or less than 5.

BUGFIX: When pausing while on break the timer correctly stops counting. But it
incorrectly says Break over! when and displays 00:00.
FIXED: It was because the counter is a little weirdo. Scheduled tasks can't be
stopped, i had to add logic that prevents that. I don't understand the library fully...
BUG: If you pause and resume before the original break interval, you get alarmed twice.
FIXED: shutdowNow() does a full shutdown, so that works.
TODO: Test this bug, and fix it
