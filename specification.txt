When i open the app i want it to display 00:00.
When i press Begin it counts and shows me that i am working.
(Break is displayed).

When i press Break, it start counting down for the duration of the break,
which lasts 5 times shorter than the time spent working.

TODO: Thread updating the time of display, right?

When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm.

***Verify that the state of display is changing (time), and then
you dont have to verify whether that works for every single case.

I have decided not to test whether the display shows the right commands,
and whether it captures state correctly, therefore saving myself millions of 
braincells.
