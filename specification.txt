REQUIREMENTS:
*When i open the app i want it to display 00:00.
*When i press Begin it counts and shows me that i am working.
*(Break is displayed).

*When i press Break, it start counting down for the duration of the break,
*which lasts 5 times shorter than the time spent working.

*When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm.

***Cancel at any time. (goes into idle)
***Pause at any time (except when idle)




PERHAPS time and period, instead of being an integer, should be refactored to value objects?

- Potential errors if you work for less than a second, or less than 5.

When the break timer runs out, we are still in break state.

FEATURE: Logging breaks and works. Also, logging how much time you 
ACTUALLY spent on a break, while the timer was 0.

TODO:
- add a reset button
- change background colors
- center everything and resize

BUGFIX: When pausing while on break the timer correctly stops counting. But it
incorrectly says Break over! when and displays 00:00.
FIXED: It was because the counter is a little weirdo. Scheduled tasks can't be
stopped, i had to add logic that prevents that. I don't understand the library fully...
BUG: If you pause and resume before the original break interval, you get alarmed twice.
FIXED: shutdowNow() does a full shutdown, so that works.

COLORS:
    Working: You might want to use a calming color like Green to signify productive work.
     Green is often associated with growth and positive progress.

    Taking Break: Use a contrasting color like Blue to indicate a shift in focus.
     Blue is calming and can represent relaxation.

    Idle: Consider using a neutral color like Gray for the idle state.
     Gray can signify a state of inactivity or waiting.

    Work Pause: A slightly lighter or desaturated shade of your Working color
     can signify a temporary pause in work.

    Break Pause: Similarly, use a lighter or desaturated shade of your Taking
     Break color to signify a temporary pause during a break.

    Break Finished: To signal the end of a break, you can use a brighter shade
     or a transition back to the Working color to indicate the return to work.
