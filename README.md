## Use cases
- When I open the app I want it to display 00:00.
- When I press Begin it counts up, and shows me that I am working. (You have the option of going on break).
- When I press Break, it start counting down for a period 5 times shorter than the time spent working.
- When it reaches zero, it plays an alarm.
- Cancel at any time.
- Pause and resume at any time, while resting or working.
- Logs your sessions in a file.
- I can see images of clocks representing my past study and break sessions in a day. I can see which date and weekday the clocks belong to. When I open a clock, I see an enlarged image, with a big date and weekday at the bottom. Also time spent working and resting.
